        Greetings! I'm Jothish, a final-year Information Technology student at Sri Shakthi Institute of Engineering and Technology <span className="text-green-500">having a cgpa of 8.00</span>. Pursuing my schooling at Holy Innocent School and Junior College, I undertook the challenging  <span className="text-green-500">ISC Syllabus</span>, further enhancing my analytical and critical thinking abilities.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I've excelled in sports, particularly as a <span className="text-green-500">national-level hockey player</span>, where I've honed discipline, teamwork, and strategic thinking both on and off the field. My dedication to sports has instilled in me invaluable qualities of resilience and leadership, which I seamlessly integrate into my academic and professional endeavors. At the college level, I've also competed in interzone level hockey, further showcasing my passion and commitment to the sport.

Moreover, my love for strategic games extends to chess, where I've demonstrated a keen understanding of tactics and planning, fostering a deep appreciation for strategic decision-making in various aspects of life.
